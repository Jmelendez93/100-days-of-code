# 100 Days Of Code - Log

 ### Day 1: June 13, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Sum of Fib sequence below 4million, sum of multiples of 3 or 5 below threshold. Both in C++. Checked out Hackerrank and did basic intro Hello, World problems.

**Thoughts:** Made a lot of silly mistakes in algorithms. So far, pretty basic problems to solve with loops and recursion. Hackerrank syntax is different from what I'm accustomed to. Lots of vectors instead of regular arrays.

 ### Day 2: June 14, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Fraction class complete, no compile errors

**Thoughts:** Followed C++ data structures and algorithms book to create Fraction class. Was getting errors from overload functions. Was due to location of the function, which I had before the class definitions. Move to below the class definition in Fraction.cpp and fixed the errors.

 ### Day 3: June 15, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Testdome assignment: Find pairs of indices from vector that sum up to given value; Codebytes assignment:have the function LongestWord(sen) take the sen parameter being passed and return the largest word in the string.

**Thoughts:** Need to review string manipulation and vectors. Got stuck mostly on syntax. Algorithms weren't tough, but how to manipulate the data structure to accomplish task proved tricky.

 ### Day 4: June 16, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Hackerrank simple array sum. Shorter day than normal due to plans with friends.

**Thoughts:** I am not used to iterators and am having trouble with them and vectors still. Tried using iterators to sum, could not get program to run properly. Ended up using indexes in for loop instead of iterators. Will need to work on iterators down the line.

 ### Day 5: June 17, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Hackerrank big sum, diagonal array sum, # sign staircase

**Thoughts:** Much more comfortable with iterators and vectors today. Can do most basic operations with them now.

### Day 6: June 18, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Hackerrank triple comparison, min-max, and birthday candles height problem.

**Thoughts:** Ready for something a little more challenging. Need to push myself!
