# 100 Days Of Code - Log

 ### Day 1: June 13, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Sum of Fib sequence below 4million, sum of multiples of 3 or 5 below threshold. Both in C++. Checked out Hackerrank and did basic intro Hello, World problems.

**Thoughts:** Made a lot of silly mistakes in algorithms. So far, pretty basic problems to solve with loops and recursion. Hackerrank syntax is different from what I'm accustomed to. Lots of vectors instead of regular arrays.
