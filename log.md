# 100 Days Of Code - Log

 ### Day 1: June 13, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Sum of Fib sequence below 4million, sum of multiples of 3 or 5 below threshold. Both in C++. Checked out Hackerrank and did basic intro Hello, World problems.

**Thoughts:** Made a lot of silly mistakes in algorithms. So far, pretty basic problems to solve with loops and recursion. Hackerrank syntax is different from what I'm accustomed to. Lots of vectors instead of regular arrays.

 ### Day 2: June 14, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Fraction class complete, no compile errors

**Thoughts:** Followed C++ data structures and algorithms book to create Fraction class. Was getting errors from overload functions. Was due to location of the function, which I had before the class definitions. Move to below the class definition in Fraction.cpp and fixed the errors.
