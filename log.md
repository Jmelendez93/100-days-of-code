# 100 Days Of Code - Log

 ### Day 1: June 13, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Sum of Fib sequence below 4million, sum of multiples of 3 or 5 below threshold. Both in C++. Checked out Hackerrank and did basic intro Hello, World problems.

**Thoughts:** Made a lot of silly mistakes in algorithms. So far, pretty basic problems to solve with loops and recursion. Hackerrank syntax is different from what I'm accustomed to. Lots of vectors instead of regular arrays.

 ### Day 2: June 14, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Fraction class complete, no compile errors

**Thoughts:** Followed C++ data structures and algorithms book to create Fraction class. Was getting errors from overload functions. Was due to location of the function, which I had before the class definitions. Move to below the class definition in Fraction.cpp and fixed the errors.

 ### Day 3: June 15, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Testdome assignment: Find pairs of indices from vector that sum up to given value; Codebytes assignment:have the function LongestWord(sen) take the sen parameter being passed and return the largest word in the string.

**Thoughts:** Need to review string manipulation and vectors. Got stuck mostly on syntax. Algorithms weren't tough, but how to manipulate the data structure to accomplish task proved tricky.

 ### Day 4: June 16, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Hackerrank simple array sum. Shorter day than normal due to plans with friends.

**Thoughts:** I am not used to iterators and am having trouble with them and vectors still. Tried using iterators to sum, could not get program to run properly. Ended up using indexes in for loop instead of iterators. Will need to work on iterators down the line.

 ### Day 5: June 17, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Hackerrank big sum, diagonal array sum, # sign staircase

**Thoughts:** Much more comfortable with iterators and vectors today. Can do most basic operations with them now.

### Day 6: June 18, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Hackerrank triple comparison, min-max, and birthday candles height problem.

**Thoughts:** Ready for something a little more challenging. Need to push myself!

### Day 7: June 19, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Basic Java classes and structure. Compiled one via Notepad and then installed Eclipse and NetBeans IDEs.

**Thoughts:** Java is pretty similar to C++, just trying to get down the differences and start learning libraries soon. Best way to learn it is by comparing and contrasting from what I already know with C languages.

### Day 8: June 20, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Basic Java classes and structure. Employee, Loop sum, and non zeros projects. Incomplete non zeros project.

**Thoughts:** Java is pretty similar to C++, just trying to get down the differences and start learning libraries soon. Best way to learn it is by comparing and contrasting from what I already know with C languages. Non zeros project not giving correct answer due to repeating a value in loop...

### Day 9: June 21, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Sections 1-5 of Udemy Python Bootcamp

**Thoughts:** Mostly basic review. A few things I hadn't learned properly first time around. Gone over data types, operators, statements, etc. Methods, functions, OOP all coming up soon.

### Day 10: June 22, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Section 6 18/24. Included programming exercises. Completed all exersises correctly.

**Thoughts:** Lots of practice today! The coding exercises, though challenging, were completed with the correct output. My prior programming knowledge helped with the algorithms and methods used. Not bad overall. Looking forward to tomorrow's progress.

### Day 11: June 23, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Section 6 24/24 done (Practice exercises included). Milestone project Udemy Python Bootcamp completed and debugged with test cases.

**Thoughts:** Practice problems took a bit, but not too tough. Challenge came with tic tac toe project. Lots of logical challenges I came across, especially with regards to the order of statements. In particular, was getting looping issues and issues ending the game. In the end, finally resolved the issues.

### Day 12: June 24, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Section 8-10 + Milestone 2 project.

**Thoughts:** Mostly familiar material from prior programming experience apart from import content and a few other things. Milestone project was a game of blackjack. Took a while due to all the components, but got the logic down and completed the project! Not too many problems.

### Day 13: June 25, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Worked with regular expressions and finished up advanced section. Course complete.

**Thoughts:** Regular expressions are tricky! Going to take a while to get the hang of them. May start AWS soon

### Day 14: June 26, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Looked around AWS

**Thoughts:** AWS makes very little sense, so trying to make some sense of it. Created the EC2 instance and developed first "app", but not sure what to do with it.

### Day 15: June 27, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Did a few of the Python problems. Finished with a medium: the triangle angle calculation

**Thoughts:** Ran into precision issues, but programs were fairly simple.

### Day 16: June 28, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Tried medium level. Struggled! Was problem with dense rank

**Thoughts:** Could not complete. Work in progress.
